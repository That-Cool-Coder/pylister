# pylister

A program to give you stats about your python files, such as amount of functions.

## Code Organisation

There are currently three main files.

#### main.py
This is the driver and gui manager.

#### lister.py
This is the file that counts things.

## GUI
The gui is done using wxPython. This allows loading from xrc files instead of manually coding every widget.
